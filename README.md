# Encoding-decoding-
#encoding & decoding project

Welcome to the best Encoding and Decoding Tools, developed by Manan Pasricha. This project provides a simple yet powerful tool for encoding and decoding text using a key-based encryption and decryption mechanism. It supports both Linux and Windows platforms, with an executable file for Windows and a bash script for Linux.

Features
Encryption: Encode your text by shifting each character by a specified key value.
Decryption: Decode your text by reversing the shift using the same key value.
Platform Compatibility: Available for both Linux and Windows users.

How to Use
Encoding: Select the encoding option and provide the text along with a key to get the encrypted text.

Decoding: Select the decoding option and provide the encrypted text along with the key to get the original text.

NOTE: KEY is a NUMBER from which the encryption and decryption process will take place so KEEP the key number in your mind FOREVER
